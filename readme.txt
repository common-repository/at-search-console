== Description ==

Fellow marketers! Are you tired of jumping through hoops to access your Google Search Console data for a specific page? Introducing AT Search Console - the plugin that brings you a quick link to Google Search Console for any page of your website. No more hassle, no more extra clicks, no more delays! With WP Search Console, you can jump into monitoring your website's clicks, positions, and optimize your site for better search performance in no time. 

We marketers don't need a plugin to install the tracking code for Search Console on WordPress. That's not the purpose of AT Search Console. Neither do we need a plugin to display search console analytics data in the WordPress dashboard. Instead, our plugin focuses on giving you quick and direct access to your Google Search Console data, right from your WordPress admin bar and for the specific page you are visiting. That's it!

AT Search Console Features

- Easy and quick access to your website's search performance data in Google Search Console.
- A seamless integration with your WordPress website
- Accessibility only for users with the 'manage_options' capability, ensuring you stay in control of your search visibility.

This plugin is only for marketers that already have an active property on Google Search Console for their websites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What to do after installing the plugin? =

Just visit any page on your website (front-end) and click on the "View in Search Console" menu item at the top nav bar (the one that is only visible to you when you are logged in as an admin or editor).

= What about if I have still not set up my Google Saerch Console? =

No problem at all! The plugin will redirect you to the Google Search Console pointing to the property for your domain and you'll see a message that reads: "Oops, you don't have access to this property, Verify your ownership". You can start the verification process from there."
